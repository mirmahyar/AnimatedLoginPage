Login pages are exciting ! Like when you want to enter a building ! 

This project is the result of me, playing with the REACT-SPRING animation library. 

While watching a youtube video about REACT-SPRING, creating a similar page, I told myself: WHY not build my own login page, based on what I have learned?
And this project was started ! 

Still can be enhanced in many ways, so I will gradually work on it in the future. 

By the way, this REACT-SPRING library is awesome ! I will use it more in the future !
